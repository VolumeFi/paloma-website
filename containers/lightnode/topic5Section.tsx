        “My team at Vitwit are proud contributors to the Paloma protocol. We work with the best engineering teams in the
        Cosmos ecosystem. We enabled Paloma to be the first Cosmos-SDK chain to deploy Cosmos-SDK 0.50.0 into
        production. We also engineered Paloma to be the fastest Cosmos chain with its 750ms block times as well as its
        optimistic execution. Paloma is as fast as Osmosis and Sei while also as powerful as Monad and Dydx”.
