        of the Cosmos technologies Paloma users on its Cosmos-SDK blockchain. I am passionate to
        help Paloma reach more developers that want to create and schedule smart contract execution
        across multiple chains. Paloma LightNodes will broaden the community of active stakers and
        it will encourage more validators to secure the network. Let’s fly!”
