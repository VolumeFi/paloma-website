      "Nectar is a decentralized delta-hedged stablecoin built on Arbitrumâ€™s GMX. We need
        decentralized custody of users' funds on a fast L2 like Arbitrum. With Paloma, we get a
        low-cost, secure, and fast state transition system. The Paloma SDK is an easy platform for us to deliver new DeFi
        composability and yield. The Paloma validator-set handles our need for decentralized liquidity
        custody, execution and security. Every DeFi app should have a Paloma strategy."
